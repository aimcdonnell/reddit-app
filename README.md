# Reddit App: Portfolio Project

## Description
For this project, I built an application for Reddit, incorporating React and Redux. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application allows users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.

## Software and Languages used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Reddit API (.json() version)
- Jest
- Enzyme

## Challenges faced
- Connecting Reddit to the app - pics.json page has a complicated structure which makes it hard to find the data you need
- The thumbnail images are very small and become pixellated when stretched to fit the content box
- Linking the Reddit post comments to each post - the data.data.children.data structure was not intuitive
