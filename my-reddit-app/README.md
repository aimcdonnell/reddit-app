# Reddit App: Portfolio Project

## Description
â€‹For this project, I built an application for Reddit, called Seddit, incorporating React and Redux. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application allows users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.

## Software and Languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Reddit API (.json() version)

## Challenges faced

- Connecting Reddit to the app - trying to work out how to map over the posts to display them in the app. Also trying to work out how to make the code work from the <Card/> component rather than in the <App/> component
- Displaying all images in the app - some images (post.thumbnail images) were small and then became pixellated when enlarged, other images (post.url images)
